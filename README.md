# üß† PR Reviewer ‚Äì Claude-Powered GitHub PR Review System

A Python-based intelligent tool to **automate pull request analysis** using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), developed by Anthropic. This system seamlessly integrates GitHub, Claude Desktop, and Notion to simplify and accelerate code review processes in modern development workflows.

## üöÄ Overview

Code reviews are critical but time-consuming. This system enables **Claude** to act as an autonomous PR reviewer via MCP, fetching code diffs, analyzing changes, and optionally documenting results in Notion.

Inspired by the guide by [Bhavik Jikadara](https://medium.com/@bhavikjikadara), this project shows how to set up an end-to-end Claude-powered review workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîÅ Automatically fetch pull request changes via GitHub API
- üß† Claude Desktop integration using MCP for structured analysis
- üßæ Optional Notion logging of PR summaries
- ‚öôÔ∏è MCP server setup using `fastmcp` and CLI tools
- üß™ Modular Python structure for extensions or integration with CI/CD
